# CufflessAI: An Educational Blood Pressure Estimation

**Company / Org:** Microsoft  
**Challenge Advisor:** Wee Hyong Tok, weehyong@gmail.com  
**Program:** Break Through Tech AI Studio - Fall 2026

## 🏢 About Microsoft

Microsoft is a global technology company that specializes in software, services, devices, and solutions. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, focusing on innovation and technology impact across various industries.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use public physiological signal data, including photoplethysmography (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and arterial blood pressure waveforms, and supervised machine learning regression techniques to build an educational model that estimates systolic and diastolic blood pressure from pulse-signal features. This will help our organization address the need for responsible, hands-on AI education by giving students experience with real-world sensor data, signal preprocessing, model evaluation, and the limitations of health-related machine learning prototypes.

### Success Criteria
Production of a complete, responsible, end-to-end ML prototype; evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE); comparison of at least two regression models against a naive baseline.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | Data Understanding | Explore dataset, handle missing values, document findings |
| **October** | Model Development | Train baseline model, experiment with approaches, iterate |
| **November** | Evaluation & Presentation | Finalize model, prepare presentation, document results |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff only — remove before sharing with students)*

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | The tech stack is centered on Python, aligning with the fellows' experience and academic requirements. |
| Data Readiness | YELLOW | While the data is publicly available, preprocessing may be needed because it originates in different formats (CSV/TSV and MATLAB), which could require additional effort. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | No specialized hardware required; free-tier tools (Google Colab) can meet the project's needs at no additional cost. |

**Student Fit Score:** 7/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 8/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The project leverages relevant and compelling datasets for public health applications, providing a rich educational opportunity. However, we should consider simplifying aspects of the machine learning techniques to better align with the fellows' existing expertise in basic modeling or provide supplementary resources. Ensuring students are adequately prepared for the unique characteristics of working with medical data is crucial. I recommend working closely with mentors to address these challenges.
